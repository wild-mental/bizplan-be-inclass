# COMMENTS

## Basic Comments
- All code must include comments that provide thorough, general explanations of engineering processes, understandable to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- Comments should clearly describe intent, business context, core logic, workflow steps, and potential edge cases in plain language.
- Remove or update any outdated or inaccurate comments without exception.
- Explanations must allow first-time readers to easily grasp the rationale, structure, and purpose of the code, facilitating effective collaboration and future maintenance.
- When technical terminology is unavoidable, include brief clarifications or examples in plain English to ensure clarity for non-engineers.

## Engineer Friendly Comments
- For code implementing highly abstract algorithms, comments must explicitly address:
  - How memory is allocated, utilized, and potentially released at both the language and system level.
  - The lifecycle and scope of key variables and data structures throughout the execution.
  - The management of dependencies, including external libraries or system resources, and any initialization/cleanup requirements.
  - The relationship between the algorithm and the surrounding call structure (e.g., entry points, synchronous/asynchronous flows, error propagation).
- Such comments should clarify not just "what" the code does, but "how" it interacts with lower-level platform features and why specific engineering decisions were made, supporting future troubleshooting and optimization.
